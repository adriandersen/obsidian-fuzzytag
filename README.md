# Fuzzytag

Based on the Obsidian Frontmatter Tag Suggest plugin
https://github.com/jmilldotdev/obsidian-frontmatter-tag-suggest/commit/d80bcfb64d96d7fcb908deb5f4b0c9c8041c267c

This plugin has been made because fuzzy search would change the functionality of the original plugin, which might not be desired by everyone.

## Known issues:

Hacky implementation of highlighting in suggestions means that tags with special characters (`<` or `>`) might break. Feel free to submit a PR if this doesnt work with your workflow.
