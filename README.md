# Fuzzytag

Based on the Obsidian Frontmatter Tag Suggest plugin
https://github.com/jmilldotdev/obsidian-frontmatter-tag-suggest/commit/d80bcfb64d96d7fcb908deb5f4b0c9c8041c267c

This plugin has been made because fuzzy search would change the functionality of the original plugin, which might not be desired by everyone.

## Known issues:

Hacky implementation of highlighting in suggestions means that tags with special characters (`<` or `>`) might break. Feel free to submit a PR if this doesnt work with your workflow.

---

-   Check if [someone already developed a plugin for what you want](https://obsidian.md/plugins)! There might be an existing plugin similar enough that you can partner up with.
-   Make a copy of this repo as a template with the "Use this template" button (login to GitHub if you don't see it).
-   Clone your repo to a local development folder. For convenience, you can place this folder in your `.obsidian/plugins/your-plugin-name` folder.
-   Install NodeJS, then run `npm i` in the command line under your repo folder.
-   Run `npm run dev` to compile your plugin from `main.ts` to `main.js`.
-   Make changes to `main.ts` (or create new `.ts` files). Those changes should be automatically compiled into `main.js`.
-   Reload Obsidian to load the new version of your plugin.
-   Enable plugin in settings window.
-   For updates to the Obsidian API run `npm update` in the command line under your repo folder.

## Releasing new releases

-   Update your `manifest.json` with your new version number, such as `1.0.1`, and the minimum Obsidian version required for your latest release.
-   Update your `versions.json` file with `"new-plugin-version": "minimum-obsidian-version"` so older versions of Obsidian can download an older version of your plugin that's compatible.
-   Create new GitHub release using your new version number as the "Tag version". Use the exact version number, don't include a prefix `v`. See here for an example: https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-sample-plugin/releases
-   Upload the files `manifest.json`, `main.js`, `styles.css` as binary attachments. Note: The manifest.json file must be in two places, first the root path of your repository and also in the release.
-   Publish the release.

> You can simplify the version bump process by running `npm version patch`, `npm version minor` or `npm version major` after updating `minAppVersion` manually in `manifest.json`.
> The command will bump version in `manifest.json` and `package.json`, and add the entry for the new version to `versions.json`

## Adding your plugin to the community plugin list

-   Check https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases/blob/master/plugin-review.md
-   Publish an initial version.
-   Make sure you have a `README.md` file in the root of your repo.
-   Make a pull request at https://github.com/obsidianmd/obsidian-releases to add your plugin.

## How to use

-   Clone this repo.
-   `npm i` or `yarn` to install dependencies
-   `npm run dev` to start compilation in watch mode.

## Manually installing the plugin

-   Copy over `main.js`, `styles.css`, `manifest.json` to your vault `VaultFolder/.obsidian/plugins/your-plugin-id/`.

## Improve code quality with eslint (optional)

-   [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) is a tool that analyzes your code to quickly find problems. You can run ESLint against your plugin to find common bugs and ways to improve your code.
-   To use eslint with this project, make sure to install eslint from terminal:
    -   `npm install -g eslint`
-   To use eslint to analyze this project use this command:
    -   `eslint main.ts`
    -   eslint will then create a report with suggestions for code improvement by file and line number.
-   If your source code is in a folder, such as `src`, you can use eslint with this command to analyze all files in that folder:
    -   `eslint .\src\`
